riak_mongo makes Riak look like Mongo. In the first step, it will allow Mongo drivers to seamlessly connect to it using Mongo Wire Protocol and to map to the underlying Riak data store. In the next step it also might be interesting to have a Mongo based Riak backend.

Currently, I'm working on the very basic implementation of the Wire protocol, working my way
through different packet types. Right now, you can get the mongo shell connecting to the
server. I use to do "make dev" after compilation and to call

> riak_mongo:start(temporary, "127.0.0.1", 32323).

The mongo shell is called like "mongo --verbose -port 32323". And I get the prompt now.
No SSL and no IPv6 yet, just the first basics. Also
the beauty of the code can be discussed, but shouldn't be yet.

The very huge task will of course be to understand and translate to Riak all the
mongo commands. But hey, the first step is done.

riak_mongo makes Riak look like Mongo to clients. In the first step, it will allow Mongo drivers to seamlessly connect to it using Mongo Wire Protocol and to map to the underlying Riak data store. In the next step it also might be interesting to have a Mongo based Riak backend.

Run it in a Riak node instance using:

> riak_mongo:start(temporary, "127.0.0.1", 32323).

I use the low level riak_kv Erlang API to talk to the local store. Right now, you can connect to it from the Mongo shell on the same machine using:

$ mongo --verbose -port 32323 collection

Buckets in the Riak store must be named like "collection.things" - the prefix is thus the name of the database you connect from the Mongo shell to.

No auth, SSL and no IPv6 are considered yet - the implementiation is growing. Also the beauty of the code can be discussed, but shouldn't be yet.

The very huge task will of course be to understand and translate to Riak all the
mongo commands. But hey, the first step is done.
